# 3D-Pose-Estimation-using-OpenPose-Kinect
Here I have described how 3D Pose estimation can be obtained using OpenPose and RGB and Depth Images from Kinect.

### Conversion of Dat raw files to any viewable format like .bmp, .png, .jpg. ###
Here we are converting color image and depth images in the form of .dat files from Kinect to .bmp files and saving it in a folder.

### 3D Pose Estimation ###
Here the 3D Pose estimation is performed by using RGB Images, Depth Images, mat files obtained from 2D Pose estimation using OpenPose. Only 3D Pose estimation values for 25 keypoints are stored in excel file. The values can also be stored in the form of 3D Point Cloud format (PCD).

### Converting 2D Data from OpenPose (JSON file) to 2D annotations in MATLAB. ###
This folder gives information of how to convert 2D Data obtained from OpenPose to 2D annotations in MATLAB.
